Apples WWDC just finished and one of the headlining features was Apple Intelligence. It is Siri, but now has access to LLMS locally.
It is able to control your device and get information from internet sources like blogs or wikis. It is also able to access emails and messages locally, and then cross-reference with internet sources.

Example:
Telling you when you need to leave work (maps) to get home to get ready for food out (messages) and then to you're friend's house (contacts) at the right time (messages) (maps).

It can do all of that in less than 10 seconds thanks to the stupidly fast ARM CPUs in their phones. All of this is local and they pledge to not send it anywhere that isn't your phone.
Siri can also send you around your phone during this process and also when you ask where something is.

Example:
Where did James give me the link to the AirBNB we are staying in later this summer.

Siri will then launch into the message/email thread that was about the topic requested. Again, all of this is on-device so no privacy concerns (I'm looking at you Google, not cool).

## ChatGPT!?
Yes, Siri can now talk to ChatGPT (4o and all). If you are a paying user it will allow you to link your account so you can access GPT4. Siri will decide whether it is possible to run this on-device and will say if not, "This is complicated, can I send this to ChatGPT to process?" and if you confirm it will send it the prompt and the data required to process and then stream it back to your device for playback.

## MacOS 18: Sequoia
MacOS 18 now is here with new features like Handoff. Like iPhone mirroring which, as the name implies, mirrors you're iPhone to your Mac. 
Why? I don't know!
So, what else?
No clue.
